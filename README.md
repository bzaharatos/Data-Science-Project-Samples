# Data Science Project Samples
This repository includes a few data science lessons that I've developed as a faculty member at the University of Colorado, Boulder. In particular:

In the notebook titled "Introduction to Bayesian Inference", we (1) explore the role of stopping rules in Bayesian and frequentist inference, (2) apply Bayes' theorem in order to infer the value of an unknown parameter, (3) quantify uncertainty about an inference, and (4) compute predictions via the posterior predictive distribution.

In the notebook titled "Advanced Bayesian statistical modeling", we implement various computational algorithms in the Bayesian Generalized Linear Model context.
